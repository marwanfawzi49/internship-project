Feature: Filter properties by Presale status
  As a user
  I want to filter properties by their sale status
  So that I can view only properties that are in Presale status

  Background:
    Given the user is on the main page "https://soft.reelly.io"
    And the user is logged into the application

  Scenario: User filters properties by Presale status
    When the user clicks on "Off-plan" from the left side menu
    Then the "Off-plan" page should open successfully
    When the user filters by sale status "Presale"
    Then only products with sale status "Presale" should be displayed
